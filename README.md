# Project 1

## Description
This webpage is the second assignment for ENGO551 at the University of Calgary. 
The objective was to become familiarized with the communication techniques between Flask, SQL, 
HTML, Python, and JSON for web design applications.

The objective was to create a book review website using a provided database (books.csv) and 
encorporating the GoodReads API for more book-rating content.

## Contents
I chose to call the website "Buenida Book Reviews", after the town in my favorite book,
<i>100 Years of Solitude</i>.

The website contains a homepage (/index), a registration page (/signup), a login page (/login), 
a search page (/member/search), and a book details page (/member/search/details). 
It uses the Bootstrap 4 library, CSS styling, and many libraries offered by Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Python.

The repository contains:
- a Python file for the Flask application, application.py
- a static folder for CSS styles
- a folder of HTML templates for each webpage
- a Python file for the books.csv import into the database, import.py
- the books.csv data file
